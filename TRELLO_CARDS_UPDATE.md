## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS

### Technical Decisions Made:
- ✅ Stick with vanilla JavaScript (no React/Vue framework)
- ✅ Use Bootstrap 5 for rapid UI development
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design approach
- ✅ External CDN libraries (Bootstrap, Font Awesome)

### API Integration Strategy:
- **Weather Data:** Visual Crossing (most comprehensive free tier)
- **Brazilian Data:** BrasilAPI (government-backed, reliable)
- **Country Data:** REST Countries (simple, no auth required)

### Risk Mitigation:
- All APIs have generous free tiers or no limits
- Fallback to static data if APIs are unavailable
- Local storage for offline functionality
- Error handling for all external calls
